# A three-stage detection and recognition pipeline of complex meters in wild
This is the first released system towards detection and recognition of complex meters in wild. The system can be divided into three moduels. Fisrtly, a yolo-based detector is applied to get pure meter region. Secondly, a spatial transformer module is eatablished to rectify the position of meter. Lastly, an end-to-end network is to read meter values, which is implemented by pointer/dail predcition and key number learning.

## ToDo List

- [x] Release testing code
- [x] Release training code and dataset
- [x] existing models
- [ ] A new branch for digital-meter recognition
- [x] Document for testing
- [x] Document for training
- [x] Demo script for single image


## Installation

### Requirements:
- Python3 (Python3.7 is recommended)
- PyTorch >= 1.0 
- torchvision from master
- numpy
- skimage
- OpenCV==3.0.x
- CUDA >= 9.0 (10.0 is recommended)

## meter detection
we use official yolov5 to detect meters in the wild
we release a dataset for meter detection in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RKcqJ0RWaBPpBbMtWwcgQ4S66Iwf97RS/view?usp=drive_link the label is yolo-format, and label 0 and 1 represent pointer and digital meter.
we also provide trained weight in https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bHYpJro3ERmNTRO2JEo1inyU0_juqw5z/view?usp=drive_link You dan download it and put it in the yolov5 folder for inference.


## Models
Download Trained [model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1juFFjBz9BlJEuLc_IxFj5RUz0Z_UfO0M?usp=sharing)

Please put distro_net.pt into meter_distro/weight.  
put textgraph_vgg_450.pth into model/meter_data.

## Demo 
You can run a demo script for a single image inference by two steps.

```python get_meter_area.py```. and the detected meter will be stored in scene_image_data/deteced_meter

```python predict.py``` to get distored meter and final result.
